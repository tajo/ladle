Ladle is accessible. If you want to build accessible component, the wrapping environment should be accessible and keyboard friendly too. That's why your story comes first and the side navigation / addons second.

Ladle also includes an a11y testing through [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), so you can fix any a11y violations in your components.
