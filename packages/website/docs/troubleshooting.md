If you run into problems, try to enable verbose output:

```bash
DEBUG=ladle* pnpm ladle serve
DEBUG=ladle* pnpm ladle build
```

You can also enable verbose output in the browser console by adding an item into local storage `debug: ladle*` where `debug` is the key and `ladle*` the value. In Chrome you can do that by opening the dev tools and going to the `Application` tab.

## ES Modules

Ladle embraces ES Modules and is implemented as an ES module. That requires `Node 16+` and environment that fully supports ESM.

If your enviroment doesn't support ESM (for example because of yarn pnp), you can alternatively use `@ladle/react-cjs` which is a compiled version of `@ladle/react`. The support is limited and we will stop publishing the `commonjs` version at some point.
